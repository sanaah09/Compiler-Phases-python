# Phase 5: Code Optimization

This phase implements Code Optimization, which is the fifth phase of a compiler.

Code optimization improves the intermediate code generated in the previous phase
without changing the meaning or output of the program. The goal is to make the
code more efficient by eliminating unnecessary computations.

In this implementation, a simple optimization technique is used:
- Removal of redundant temporary variables
- Simplification of assignments

Example:

Before Optimization:
t1 = c * d
t2 = b + t1
a = t2

After Optimization:
t1 = c * d
a = b + t1

The temporary variable t2 is removed because it is not required.

Language Used:
Python

Files in This Folder:
- optimizer.py – Python program for code optimization
- optimizer_input.txt – Intermediate code before optimization
- optimizer_output.txt – Optimized intermediate code
- README.md – Documentation for Phase 5

How to Run:
1. Open a terminal in this folder.
2. Run the following command:
   python3 optimizer.py
3. The optimized code will be generated in optimizer_output.txt
