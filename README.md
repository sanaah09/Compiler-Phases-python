This project implements the six phases of a compiler using Python as part of the Compiler Design course.

The phases include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and code generation.

Each phase is implemented separately to clearly understand the working of a compiler.

A modern AI tool, ANTLR, is also explored to understand automatic lexer and parser generation.

Language Used: Python

Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete compiler workflow using Python and introduces the use of AI tools in compiler design.
