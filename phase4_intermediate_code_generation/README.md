Phase 4: Intermediate Code Generation

This phase implements Intermediate Code Generation, which is the fourth phase of a compiler.

The intermediate code generator converts a semantically correct program into
machine-independent intermediate code using Three Address Code (TAC).

Language Used: Python

Files:
- icg.py: Generates three address code
- icg_input.txt: Input expression
- icg_output.txt: Generated intermediate code
